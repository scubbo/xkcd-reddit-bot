Note to self - you ran this overnight on 2020-10-07, and found no xkcd-links in the entire night.
Either your regex is broken, or you're not persisting properly, or (most likely) the density
of XKCD-links is too sparse to make this a tenable project.

Check your email for `obligatoryxkcdreddit` for info about the bot/Reddit account.

If you pick this back up again - do it properly, and use `logging` for persisting the data,
and use a more sensible format than this Franken-CSV.
